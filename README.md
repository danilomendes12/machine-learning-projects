## My Personal Machine Learning Notebook
Welcome to my Machine Learning Notebook! This repository is a collection of all the code and experiments I've worked on during my journey into the fascinating world of machine learning. Here, you'll find:

- Custom Implementations: Algorithms that I've built from scratch to deepen my understanding.
- Comparisons: Side-by-side comparisons of my implementations with popular machine learning libraries.
- Modular Structure: Each module is dedicated to a different topic in machine learning, making it easy to navigate and explore.


### Always a Work in Progress
This project is an ongoing exploration. I'll be updating it periodically with new algorithms, improvements, and insights as I continue to learn.
